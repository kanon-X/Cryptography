# Cryptology

Cryptology is divided into two main areas: **cryptography** and **cryptanalysis**.  
- **Cryptography** focuses on techniques for encrypting and decrypting information.  
- **Cryptanalysis** studies methods for breaking encrypted information.

## Core Concepts

### Encryption
The process of converting information into an unreadable form.  
- Performed using an **algorithm** and a **key**.

### Decryption
The process of converting encrypted information back into its original form.  
- Also typically uses an **algorithm** and a **key**.

### Key
The secret information used in encryption and decryption processes.  
- Essential for cryptographic algorithms to function.  

### Key Management
Encompasses the processes of generating, distributing, storing, and destroying keys.  
- Secure key management is **critical** to maintaining the security of cryptography.

## Types of Keys

- **Public Key**: A key that is publicly accessible and used in **asymmetric encryption** algorithms.  
- **Private Key**: A key known and protected only by its owner.  
  - Used in conjunction with the public key to ensure secure communication.

## Cryptographic Components

### Cryptographic Algorithms
Mathematical methods used to perform encryption and decryption.  
- Examples: **AES**, **RSA**, **DES**

### Cryptographic Protocols
Sets of rules that ensure the secure use of cryptographic algorithms.  
- Examples: **SSL/TLS**, **SSH**, **IPsec**
