# 🕵️‍♂️ Challenge: Double Trouble

## 📜 Description
We intercepted a message from a suspicious server, but it seems to have been **scrambled twice**. We have included the Python script used for the encryption.

Your task is to **decrypt the message** and find the **flag**.

> 💡 **Hint:** The encryption method is not as complex as it first seems.

## 📂 Provided Files

- [encrypt.py](encrypt.py)
- [cipher.txt](cipher.txt)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze the encryption logic, reverse the scrambling process, and recover the original flag hidden inside `cipher.txt`.

Good luck, agent. The truth is buried in the code.
